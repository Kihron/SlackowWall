# What is SlackowWall?
SlackowWall is a multi-instance manager for macOS designed specifically for speedrunners, enabling control over multiple instances simultaneously.

# How It Works
When launched, SlackowWall automatically detects and displays all open instances within the main window, with a customizable layout. Users can utilize various keybinds to interact with, control, and switch between multiple instances.

SlackowWall also comes with an automatic update system, so once you have it up and running you never have to download anything again!

# OBS Integration
When the app launches, it automatically places the associated OBS script into the app's application support folder. This script will automatically switch scenes and sources to capture the current instance.
